# RGB Color Picker Game-Meaka COMP 426 Final Project

Test out your color identification skills with our javascript game. Compete against other players to try to guess the RGB of randomly generated colors in the least amount of tries and keep track of your progress and success by making an account! See where you stand on our leaderboard and hone your skils. 

## Instructions
If this is your first time visitin gour site, make an account by clicking "Create a new account with my score"! If you have visited our site before, select "Log into an existing account." If you would like to delete your account, we are sorry to see you go, but feel free to select "Delete an existing account."

Once you create an account you can start playing!

A color will appear in the middle of the screen and there will be an option to type in your guess for the RGB value. Once you are satisfied with your guess, you can click submit. You can guess multiple times until you correctly select the color! The number of guesses it takes you to guess the correct value is your score, and it will be recorded on the leaderboard in the right hand side of the screen. You can compare your score to the top scorers on our site!
