    <h2> Game Instructions </h2>
    <p>A color will appear as the background of the screen and there will be an option to type in your guess for the RGB value. <br>
      As you enter values for the Red, Green, and Blue components, the inside rectangle where the inputs are will change accordingly. <br>
      Once you are satisfied with your guess and the inside square blends perfectly into the background, you can click "Check your answer!".<br>

      If your answer is incorrect, notifications will appear below each input box with hints about whether the true value is higher or lower.<br>
       If your guess for the field is correct, you will see a message that says "You guessed red/blue/green correctly!"<br>
      
      You can guess multiple times until you correctly select the color! <br>
      The number of guesses it takes you to guess the correct value is your score, and it will be recorded on the leaderboard. <br></p>
